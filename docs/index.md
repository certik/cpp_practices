# C++ Practices

This website shows how to develop C++ code that is 100% Debug time safe (i.e.
no segfaults, undefined behavior or dangling pointers are possible, as long as
the few simple idioms described here are followed), but as performant in
the Release mode as manual raw pointer manipulation.
